## [0.11.0] — 2026-04-23

### Breaking changes

Release aligned to the QRVMC v2.0.0 ABI, which widens the VM word to
512 bits and the QRL address to 64 bytes for the Zond network.

- Stack slot is now `uint512` (512-bit big-endian integers on the
  interpreter stack).
- `qrvmc_bytes32` is 64 bytes wide (wire-level value for SSTORE/SLOAD
  values, log topics, `qrvmc_message.create2_salt`, block/transaction
  context fields).
- `qrvmc_address` is 64 bytes wide (ML-DSA-87 QRL address layout).
- New opcodes `PUSH33`..`PUSH64` at `0x80`..`0x9f`.
- `DUP1`..`DUP16` shifted from `0x80`..`0x8f` to `0xa0`..`0xaf`.
- `SWAP1`..`SWAP16` shifted from `0x90`..`0x9f` to `0xb0`..`0xbf`.
- `LOG0`..`LOG4` shifted from `0xa0`..`0xa4` to `0xc0`..`0xc4`.
- `MLOAD`/`MSTORE` now read/write 64 bytes per word.
- `CALLDATALOAD` reads 64 bytes and zero-pads on short input.
- `BYTE`/`SIGNEXTEND` index 64-byte words (valid range 0..63).
- Generic `addmod`/`mulmod` implementations for `uint512` operands
  (intx only provides native `uint256` specialisations).

### Fixed

- `CREATE2` salt default widened from `uint256{}` to `uint512{}` to
  match the widened stack slot and avoid a mixed-width ternary that
  could silently drop the upper 256 bits if intx conversion rules
  ever shift.
- Dead `load_uint<T>` helper removed; it incorrectly narrowed any
  `qrvmc_bytes32` source via `intx::be::load<uint256>`, which would
  drop the upper 32 bytes of the new 64-byte values.

### Notes

- `QRVMONE_TESTING=ON` requires the `qrvmc-vmtester` tool, which is
  not installed by the bundled qrvmc package. Ship tests stay off in
  release builds until that dependency is resolved.
